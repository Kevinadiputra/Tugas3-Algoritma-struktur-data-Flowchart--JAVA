# Algorithm and Data Structure Task Repository

**Updated: September 22, 2023**

Welcome to the Algorithm and Data Structure Task Repository! Here, you'll find an organized collection of flowcharts and Java implementations related to various scenarios. This repository was created as part of Task 3, which involves designing algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured into two main folders:

### 1. Java Implementations
In the "Java Implementations" folder, you'll find Java scripts that I created based on the corresponding flowcharts. While these scripts aim to follow the logic of the flowcharts, please note that there might be some flowcharts with inaccuracies in terms of formulas or workflow. These inaccuracies may affect the functionality of the Java implementations. 

### 2. Improved Flowcharts
The "Improved Flowcharts" folder contains enhanced and refined flowcharts. I have worked on improving these flowcharts by conducting online research and consulting with others. As a result, the flowcharts in this folder are more accurate and reliable. The Java scripts corresponding to these improved flowcharts are functional and can be executed without issues.

## Instructions for Running Java Programs

To run the Java programs from this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Open an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Intellij IDEA, Netbeans, Oracle, or use a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++.

2. Navigate to the specific Java file you want to run within the "Java Implementations" folder.

3. Before executing the program, make sure to remove the comment markers at the beginning and end of each script (/* and */). This will activate the script and allow it to run.

4. Once the comments are removed, you can compile and execute the Java program as needed.

## Contribution and Feedback

While this repository primarily showcases my individual work, I'm open to contributions and improvements. If you have ideas to enhance the flowcharts or suggestions for more feature-rich versions, please feel free to get in touch.

Thank you for exploring this repository, which represents my journey of learning and growth in the realm of algorithms and data structures. If you have any questions, feedback, or ideas to share, don't hesitate to reach out. Enjoy your experience here!
